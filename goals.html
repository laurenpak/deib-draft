            <p class="goal-head-text">Based on the data collected in the DEIB Report, as well as the reflections and contributions of members of the ‘Prince,’ we have developed the following set of goals for the coming year. We are publishing them to our readership to encourage transparency and accountability.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left; color: black; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;" class="credit-heading"><strong>Community</strong></p>
            <ol class="outer-list">
                <li>Continue to annually survey all staff and develop a similar report to evaluate the success of our diversity recruitment and inclusion efforts, which includes actively inviting historically underrepresented groups to affinity open houses.</li>
                <li>Continue the relationship-building coffee chat outreach initiative with identity-oriented groups on campus in the hopes of:
                    <ol class="sublist" type="a">
                        <li>Building and rebuilding trust in ‘Prince’ coverage and recruitment</li>
                        <li>Establishing consistent communication with historically overlooked or misrepresented communities</li>
                        <li>Encouraging a direct channel for affinity groups to communicate with our reporters about events and general information</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Continue to offer a DEIB-specific internal feedback form to offer staffers a specific avenue for sharing things they may feel uncomfortable talking about with Upper Management, especially relating to identity and inclusion.</li>
                <li>Support informal staff-led affinity groups by pushing for ‘Prince’-sponsored social events.</li>
                <li>Recognize that our own staff does not reflect the diversity of the student body and correct these failures through continued targeted recruitment efforts and critically engaging with why staffers, especially those that are first-generation low-income, may feel uncomfortable joining and engaging with the ‘Prince.’</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="text-align: left; color: black; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;" class="credit-heading"><strong>Coverage</strong></p>
            <ol class="outer-list">
                <li>Build upon the work of the 147th Board on special issues by instead publishing “supplements” on the development of a topic or group over time, and covering communities consistently throughout the year.</li>
                <li>Better integrate historically overlooked events and communities into our day-to-day production by:
                    <ol class="sublist" type="a">
                        <li>Connecting reporters and community members to each other</li>
                        <li>Holding the editorial staff accountable for communicating and assigning these pitches</li>
                        <li>Highlighting community joy and emphasizing follow-ups with communities</li>
                        <li>Working with staffers to help them feel comfortable covering content from communities that may be different from their own</li>
                        <li>Interacting with direct stakeholders when handling corrections </li>
                        <li>Continuing to track our own coverage of communities over time and how we represent them</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Build upon past <a
                        href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/02/princeton-second-annual-diversity-equity-inclusion-report">coverage</a> of University DEI initiatives and statistics.</li>
                <li>Broaden reporting outreach across ideological lines to provide more multidimensional coverage.</li>
            </ol>
